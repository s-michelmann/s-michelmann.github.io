<h4>Interactive Dynamics of Episodic Memory Lab</h4>

 <p align="justify">
 The labâ€™s future research will investigate how general knowledge representations and unique memories interact on a fast timescale. We will use electrophysiology (EEG, MEG, and intracranial EEG) combined with computational modeling and behavioral experiments to understand the neurophysiological mechanisms and the computational principles underlying such interactive dynamics of episodic memory. If you are interested in working on these topics and want to be part of the new lab at NYU, please get in touch! I will be looking for lab members at the lab manager, Ph.D. student, and postdoctoral level.

<h4>Diversity and Inclusion Statement</h4>
 <p align="justify">
Research and innovation thrive when different voices, perspectives, and experiences come together. In our lab, we welcome members from all backgrounds and identities, including but not limited to race, age, gender identity, religion, neurodiversity, and citizenship. We are committed to creating an inclusive environment where everyone feels a sense of belonging. Through a culture of listening, mutual understanding, mutual respect, open-mindedness, and a dedication to continuous learning and unlearning, we actively foster an atmosphere where every lab member can thrive and be their best self.
